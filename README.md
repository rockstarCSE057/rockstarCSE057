I have a strong passion for creating things that leave a positive impact on people,

Things that aim for something better, and have a valuable meaning in it ✨.

I'm curious about new technology and I'm eager to learn more and more,

and I have a strong determination to solve whatever problems in my way.💪


besides I love listening to music 🎵
